      <p class="mt-2">
        The growth in AI usage is accompanied by rising student expectations. Many now view AI as a core academic resource—on par with libraries and learning management systems. Despite its widespread adoption, 43% of students report never using generative AI in courses due to unclear policies or fear of misconduct accusations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. DEMOGRAPHICS -->
    <section id="demographics" class="mb-10 bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Demographic and Field Segmentation</h2>
      <p>
        The integration of College AI tools is not uniform across demographics. Usage varies based on academic level, socioeconomic status, discipline, and even personality traits.
